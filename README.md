This is a code and not actually a bot. This program computes ema(50,100 and 200) for all the trade pairs available on binance. EMA strategy is that if (50ema>100ema>200ema) and if price opens below 50 ema and close above it then there is a potential for the price of that asset to go up. You must have python 3++, pandas, requests installed on your computer.
